        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Base: Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large pan. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter. Stir in 1 finely chopped onion and sauté until golden. Add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw aroma fades. Toss in 2 finely chopped tomatoes and cook until soft and mushy.</li>
            <li>Cook the Vegetables: Add 1 medium chopped capsicum, 1/2 cup boiled green peas, 2 boiled and mashed potatoes, and 1/2 cup boiled and mashed cauliflower florets. Mix well and mash the vegetables using a potato masher. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon red chili powder, and 1 1/2 tablespoons pav bhaji masala, then cook for 2–3 minutes, letting the spices blend in.</li>
            <li>Simmer and Adjust Consistency: Pour 1/2 to 1 cup water to achieve your desired consistency. Mix thoroughly and let the bhaji simmer for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add salt to taste and a splash of lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Toast the Pav: Heat a tawa or pan and melt 2 tablespoons butter. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon pav bhaji masala (optional) and toast the pav buns on both sides until golden and slightly crispy.
            </li>
            <li>Serve and Garnish: Transfer the hot bhaji to a serving bowl and garnish with chopped coriander leaves, a dollop of butter, and chopped onions. Serve with the toasted pav, lemon wedges, and extra onions on the side.</li>

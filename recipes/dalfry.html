        <p>In Hindi language, ‘dal’ or ‘dahl’ is the generic term for lentils as well as the recipes made from lentils. Dal or lentils are a staple in Indian cuisine and make for an excellent plant-based source of protein.</p>
        <p>If you are new to Indian cuisine, you may think that the words ‘dal fry’ indicate that some ingredients are being deep fried or the lentils are fried. Let me assure you that we don’t fry anything in a dal fry.</p>

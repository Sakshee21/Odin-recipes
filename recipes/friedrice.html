        <p>This classic Veg Fried Rice recipe is made with a hearty mix of fresh vegetables, green onions, seasonings and spices for an incredibly flavorful fried rice dish. Hands-down this is one of our favorite Chinese-inspired recipes. Not only is Vegetable Fried Rice amazingly easy to make from scratch, itâ€™s a naturally vegan dish thatâ€™s as good for you as it is delicious to eat. You can even tweak veg fried rice to be gluten-free simply by omitting soy sauce or using tamari.</p>
        <h2 align="center">Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably leftover or cooled rice)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil (vegetable or sesame oil)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup carrots (finely chopped or julienned)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup green peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup capsicum (bell pepper) (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup spring onions (finely chopped, white and green parts separated)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cabbage (shredded, optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vinegar (optional, for tanginess)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili sauce (optional, for spiciness)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons spring onion greens (chopped)</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 align="center">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Base: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the white parts of spring onions and sautÃ© for a few seconds. Toss in the chopped vegetables (carrots, green peas, capsicum, and cabbage) and stir-fry on high heat for 2â€“3 minutes until slightly tender but still crisp.
            </li>
            <li>Add Seasonings: Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and, if using, add crumbled tofu as a vegetarian protein option. Mix everything together. Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 teaspoon vinegar, 1 teaspoon chili sauce (optional), salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder. Stir well to coat the vegetables and tofu with the sauces.</li>
            <li>Combine with Rice: Add the cooked rice to the pan and toss everything together on high heat, ensuring the rice absorbs the flavors evenly. Stir-fry for another 2â€“3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish and Serve: Turn off the heat and sprinkle spring onion greens on top. Serve hot with additional soy sauce or chili sauce on the side. Enjoy your delicious vegetarian fried rice! ðŸ˜Š</li>
